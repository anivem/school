Here’s a refined version of your standup comedy script: &#x20;

\*\*Disclaimer\*\* &#x20;

"Hi everyone, before we begin, a quick disclaimer: None of the incidents or advice in my talk are meant to be taken seriously or replicated. I’m a trained professional in \*bad ideas,\* so please don’t try this at home—or anywhere else for that matter." &#x20;



\*\*[Act like you’re slipping on stage]\*\* &#x20;

“Woah, woah, woah! Almost slipped there. Guys, I think there’s a \*lot\* of gravity here. Is this normal, or is someone pranking me with extra gravitation? I don’t know if I’m ready for this level of seriousness." &#x20;

\### \*\*Starting Strong: The Journey Begins\*\* &#x20;



“Let’s talk about something universal: birth. It’s the grand opening act of life, right? But did you know you can actually be one of three types of people when you’re born?” &#x20;



1\. \*\*The Elder Child:\*\* &#x20;

&#x20;  “If you’re the elder child, congratulations! You are the pilot project. Your parents look at you and say, \*'Beta, we will turn you into absolute perfection.'\* And then they throw the entire syllabus of life at you—Medicine! Engineering! Western classical! Indian classical! Kathak, piano, horse-riding, sports. And if that wasn’t enough, they’ll also casually add, ‘Beta, maybe learn how to operate the International Space Station too.’” &#x20;



2\. \*\*The Younger Sibling:\*\* &#x20;

&#x20;  “But if you’re the younger sibling, the scene changes. Your parents go, ‘Beta, we already tried this “perfect child” thing, and your elder sibling is now eating crayons for stress relief. So… do whatever you want. Just don’t set anything on fire.’” &#x20;



3\. \*\*The Only Child:\*\* &#x20;

&#x20;  “Then there’s the \*only child\*—like me. My parents, after one look at me, were like, \*‘Can we return him?’\* And when the return policy was denied, they went, \*‘Okay fine, beta. Just… be good, okay? Don’t do arts. Actually… maybe do arts. We’re confused.’” &#x20;



\---



\### \*\*Kindergarten Chronicles\*\* &#x20;



“In kindergarten, they gave us this task: \*'color the banana.'\* Now, quick question to the audience: What color is a banana? Yellow and green, right?  &#x20;

Well, in our class, kids colored bananas in every color \*except\* yellow and green—black bananas, blue bananas, red bananas, and even rainbow bananas!  &#x20;



“And summers in kindergarten? Pure madness. Our classroom had fans, but the blades weren’t attached. Yet, kids were like, \*‘Wow, kya ghoom raha hai yaar!’\* Meanwhile, the teacher is teaching ABCD, and kids are hypnotized by imaginary fans. ‘Wah hypnotism, wah.’” &#x20;



\---



\### \*\*Middle School Madness\*\* &#x20;



“Middle school lunches, ah, the \*Maggi saga.\* By the time lunch break came, your Maggi would either be a \*brick\* or a \*cake.\* And if your Maggi didn’t turn into a brick, I’d change my name to ‘Naryal Anna.’ And you know what Naryal Anna says? \*‘Ayyo ji, that’s my name ji! How can you take it ji?’\*” &#x20;



“Then kids would break the Maggi brick and share it like it’s gourmet food. \*‘Wah yaar, kya swaadisht hai!’\* And I’m like, ‘Bro, this is basically instant noodles in cement form.’” &#x20;



\---



\### \*\*Exam Time\*\* &#x20;



“And then, exams arrived. Remember those super-dangerous questions? Like: &#x20;

\*Write a letter to your brother about the importance of Bathukamma.\* &#x20;



Now, my brother and I live, eat, and sleep in the same house. Why on Earth am I writing him a letter? Does the postman just come to my house, look at me, and go, \*‘Sir, ye raha aapka patr. Iska “to” aur “from” dono same hai. Agli baar ise upar fainkiye aur catch kar lijiye.’\*” &#x20;



“For marks, I’d write anything: &#x20;

‘India follows many religions, and many religions have many cultures. That is why… Bathukamma Bathukamma Uyyalo!’” &#x20;



“Another classic: &#x20;

\*Locate the places where gold is found in India.\* &#x20;

For marks, I’d write, ‘Telangana: GRT Jewellers and Lalitha Jewellers.’” &#x20;



“And those essay questions? &#x20;

1 Mark: \*‘Why did Ram kill Ravan?’\* Because Ravan kidnapped Sita. &#x20;

2 Marks: Ram was a king. &#x20;

3 Marks: Dashrath was a king whose son was Ram. &#x20;

4 Marks: Ravan was a king, and Dashrath was also a king. &#x20;

5 Marks: India is a secular country, and we follow many religions.” &#x20;

“Okay, guys, before we get into the exam talk, let me tell you a little something funny that happened before the final exams. We had this farewell, and our Singh House vice captain came to me. He was like, ‘Bro, let’s give our names for the stand-up comedy show. We’ll crack jokes and make the 10th graders laugh.’ So, I went home and searched online for some jokes, and I thought, ‘I’ve got this!’



“I even went to my neighbor’s dog to tell it my jokes. You know what happened? The dog hit me with its owner's stick. ‘Maaara!’ My joke was so bad, it decided to take matters into its own paws. Even now, I’m still hurting from that encounter, yaar.”



[Pause for the audience to laugh]



“Now, guys, you know the classic ball joke? Alright, here it goes:

Imagine I have two balls. One in this hand, and the other in the other hand. So, let me take the ball from this hand to this hand. So now, how many balls are in this hand?

Zero, right?

Now, how many balls are in this hand?

No, there are no balls in this hand either! Look properly, it’s a trick question!”



[Now, segue into the serious note]



“On a serious note, exams are like reality shows where people get eliminated. But don’t worry, nobody here will get eliminated. You’ve got this! All the best for your exams!”



[Pause, smile mischievously]



"You know why I’m sure none of you will get eliminated? Because I’m about to conduct a pop quiz right now!"



[Pause for dramatic effect]



"Don’t worry, it’s just a little friendly quiz. You can thank me later!"



[Sign off with a bow and a smile.]   &#x20;
